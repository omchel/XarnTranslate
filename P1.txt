Project Description:
 A universal web application that performs basic translations to help Xelkalai, the alien from planet Xarnaco.
Using Python CGI Dynamic Websites, we create the program that will evaluate the input for the user, check that there is a translation for it and if there isn't, show an error for the input.

What does the CGI do if one of the fields is completely missing?
 It assumes the field was blank and returns it  an invalid input.  

What does the CGI do if the value of a field is blank?
 When printing the values, it will return the field that was blank as "None" and the translated word is returned as "invalid"

Did you test your CGI with a client such as curl?
 No.

What happens if one of the field values submitted is a string of 100 characters? 1000 characters? 10000 characters?
 It will return it as "unknown" if the string is not in the file, or as "invalid" if the other fields are empty.

How did you test the previous question?
 Inputing various different strings with various character lengths.
